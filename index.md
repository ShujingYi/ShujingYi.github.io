This project aims to use New York City as a case, study how the pandemic influenced the Airbnb market in different aspects, and provide advice for both Airbnb hosts and guests in the post-pandemic future.

### [SmartBurn-Wildfire prediction for prescribed burn](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ShujingYi/California-Wildfire/blob/main/Wildfire_Shujing%20%26%20Yuehui.html)  

Skill used: R, ArcGIS, Logistic Regression

With climate change, more and more big fires are happening in northern California. We plan to develop a wildfire prediction model from an ecological perspective by considering natural and human factors in our model and proposing a forest management system of prescribed fire. This study is to build a logistic model for a fire management App, “SmartBurn.”

### [Predicting housing prices in Mecklenburg](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ShujingYi/Midterm-Predicting-Housing-Prices/blob/main/opendata_wrangling_SY_Final.html)  
Skill used: R, OLS Modeling, Spatial Lag

As Zillow has realized that its housing market predictions are not as accurate as they could be because they do not factor in enough local intelligence in Mecklenburg, this project is to improve Zillow’s housing market predictions for Mecklenburg.

### [Space-time prediction of LA Metro bike share demand](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ShujingYi/LA-bike-share-prediction/blob/main/Bike_Share_Time_Space_2019_SY.html)  
Skill used: R, Linear Regressions

<img src="images/bike_share.jpg?raw=true"/>

One of urban bike share systems’ most challenging operational problems is the need to re-balance bicycles across the network. Re-balancing is to predict bike share demand for all docks at all times and redistribute bikes to ensure a bike or a docking place is available when needed. In this study, modeling and validation with accounting for weather and time effects and experimenting with some amenity features will give us a window into how we can use time-space predictive modeling to address an operations issue.
